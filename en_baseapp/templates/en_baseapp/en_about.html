The experience and enthusiasm of our employees allows us to develop at a fairly rapid pace. In May 2020, a pelletizing production line with a capacity of 100 tons per day was put into operation, which allows providing most of the leading feed mills in Russia, as well as plants and farms in Europe with raw materials.

						The experience and enthusiasm of our employees allows us to develop at a fairly rapid pace. In May 2020, a pelletizing production line with a capacity of 100 tons per day was put into operation, which allows providing most of the leading feed mills in Russia, as well as plants and farms in Europe with raw materials.
					</p>

					<p>
						Thanks to a well-chosen staff, a modern, technological production process worked out to the smallest detail, the quality of products, as well as love for our work, we strive to ensure the health of animals, maximum genetically inherent productivity (dairy, egg, meat – live weight gain), reduce morbidity and mortality, reduce the cost of treating livestock, increase the immune status and resistance to infections, and, as a result, increase the economic efficiency of farming.
